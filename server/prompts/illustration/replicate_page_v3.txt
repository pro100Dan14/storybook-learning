- Face should have the same artistic style as the rest of the illustration (flat, illustrated, storybook)
- NO photorealistic skin texture, NO camera-like lighting on face, NO photo-like details
- Face must be stylized to match the illustration style - flat colors, painterly texture, no photo realism

STYLE (ONE COHERENT STYLE, DO NOT MIX):
