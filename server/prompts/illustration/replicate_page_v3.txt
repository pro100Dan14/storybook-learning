You are illustrating a page of a premium children's storybook.

STYLE (ONE COHERENT STYLE, DO NOT MIX):
- high-quality Russian folk storybook illustration
- clean ink outlines, subtle gouache/watercolor texture, visible paper grain
- warm, cozy palette (ochre, muted reds, sage green, wood tones)
- soft natural lighting, believable shadows, painterly but consistent
- professional book illustration quality (not cheap, not sketchy)

MAIN CHARACTER (LOCKED — must be consistent across all pages):
- A child hero, age {age_range}
- Face must resemble the provided identity reference image (same child), but rendered in the SAME storybook illustration style (NOT a real photo).
- Hair (locked): {hair_lock}
- Outfit (locked, identical across all pages): {outfit_lock}
- Skin tone (locked): {skin_tone_lock}
- Distinctive marks (if any): {distinctive_marks_lock}

IMPORTANT IDENTITY INSTRUCTION:
- Preserve the child's recognizable facial structure (eyes spacing, nose shape, mouth proportions, cheeks) based on the identity reference.
- Render the face as a drawn/painted illustration matching the page style.
- NEVER output a photorealistic face. Never look like a pasted photograph. No collage.

SCENE (THIS PAGE):
- Location: {location}
- Time of day / lighting: {lighting}
- Mood: {mood}
- Action: {action}
- Key objects: {key_objects}
- Camera / pose: {camera_pose}
- Ensure the child's face is clearly visible (front or 3/4 view), not tiny, not occluded.

COMPOSITION:
- Medium shot preferred (3/4 body or full body)
- Face occupies at least 12–18% of image area
- No extreme close-up, no far-away tiny face
- Background should be coherent and detailed (not abstract)

STRICTLY FORBIDDEN:
- any text, letters, captions, watermarks, signatures, logos
- photorealism, DSLR look, skin pores, realistic photo lighting
- collage, cutout, pasted face, mismatched styles

Output: one complete storybook illustration image, consistent style, no text.
