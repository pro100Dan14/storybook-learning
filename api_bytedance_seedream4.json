The output must be a single illustrated portrait of the child, with maximum likeness to the reference photo.\nIDENTITY — ABSOLUTE PRIORITY: the child must look exactly like the reference child, instantly recognizable. Keep the same facial geometry: head shape, forehead, eyebrows, eye shape and spacing, nose shape, lips, cheeks, chin, ears, skin tone, hairstyle, and age appearance. Do not change facial features.\nRENDERING: semi-realistic painted portrait (not photorealistic), crisp sharp facial features, clear eyes with catchlights, subtle natural skin shading, clean edges, no blur, no smudge.\nSTYLE: premium children’s book illustration, soft watercolor/gouache feel, gentle warm light, clean linework only if needed (minimal).\nCOMPOSITION: close-up portrait (head and shoulders), centered, neutral background (soft gradient), front or slight 3/4 view, friendly natural smile, no accessories that hide face, no text.\nAVOID: chibi, kawaii, anime face, oversized eyes, generic baby face, simplified facial features, wrong identity, different hairstyle, different skin tone, heavy stylization, blur, distortion, text, watermark, logo, frame, border, collage, pasted/cutout look.",
