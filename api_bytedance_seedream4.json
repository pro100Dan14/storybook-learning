The output must be a single illustrated portrait of the child, with maximum likeness to the reference photo.\nIDENTITY — ABSOLUTE PRIORITY: the child must look exactly like the reference child, instantly recognizable.

Keep identical head/face geometry and proportions: head shape, forehead, eyebrows, eye shape and spacing, nose shape, lips, cheeks, chin, ears, skin tone, hairstyle, and age appearance.\nThe face must match the reference face image as closely as possible. NO generic face, NO different child.\n\nRENDER RULE:\nThe face is a detailed painted portrait (sharp eyes, clean edges, accurate proportions) and stays fully illustrated (not a photo cutout, not a collage).\nThe body, hands, clothes and background are in a friendly children's cartoon painting style (simplified shapes, soft painterly background).\n\nOUTFIT LOCK (same in all images):\nlight blue hoodie, dark navy jeans, white sneakers. No text anywhere.\n\nCAMERA + CONSISTENCY:\nIn each image, vary the head rotation slightly, but keep the gaze looking directly at the viewer (eye contact).\nHead angles for the 4 images:\n1) front view (0 degrees)\n2) slight left turn (about 15-25 degrees)\n3) slight right turn (about 15-25 degrees)\n4) very slight tilt (about 10-15 degrees) with near-front view\nIn all images: eyes looking at the viewer.\n\nAVOID:\nwrong identity, different face, different child, face changes, beautified face, improved face, generic baby face, anime/chibi, oversized eyes, blur, distortion, deformed hands, extra fingers, text, letters, watermark, logo, signature, frame, border, collage, cutout, pasted face.\n",
