The output must be a single illustrated portrait of the child, with maximum likeness to the reference photo.\nIDENTITY — ABSOLUTE PRIORITY: the child must look exactly like the reference child, instantly recognizable. Keep the same facial geometry: head shape, forehead, eyebrows, eye shape and spacing, nose shape, lips, cheeks, chin, ears, skin tone, hairstyle, and age appearance. Do not change facial features.\nRENDERING: realistic portrait with a bit cartoon tint, crisp sharp facial features, clear eyes with catchlights, subtle natural skin shading, clean edges, no blur, no smudge.\nSTYLE: premium children’s book illustration, realistic, gentle warm light, clean linework only if needed (minimal).\nCOMPOSITION: close-up portrait (head and shoulders), centered, neutral background (soft gradient), front or slight 3/4 view, friendly natural smile, no accessories that hide face, no text.\nAVOID: chibi, kawaii, anime face, oversized eyes, generic baby face, simplified facial features, wrong identity, different hairstyle, different skin tone, heavy stylization, blur, distortion, text, watermark, logo, frame, border, collage, pasted/cutout look.",

The child must be instantly recognizable.\nDo NOT change identity or “improve” the face.

No generic face, no different child.\n\nEXPRESSION (CONTEXT-DRIVEN, IDENTITY UNCHANGED):\nMatch the facial expression to the scene context and mood in each image. Change ONLY the expression (muscles), not the identity: do not alter facial features, proportions, skin tone, hairstyle, or age. Avoid exaggerated cartoon/anime expressions.\n\nRENDER RULE:\nFace = detailed painted portrait (sharp eyes, clean edges), fully illustrated (no cutout/collage).\nBody/clothes/hands/background = friendly children’s cartoon painting but with clear painting\n\nOUTFIT LOCK (same in all images):\nlight blue hoodie, dark navy jeans, white sneakers.\n\nCAMERA:\nVary head angle slightly between images, but keep gaze looking directly at the viewer (eye contact).\n\nAVOID:\nwrong identity, different child, face changes, beautified face, generic baby face, anime/chibi, oversized eyes, blur, distortion, deformed hands, extra fingers, watermark, logo, signature, frame, border, collage, cutout, pasted face.\n",
